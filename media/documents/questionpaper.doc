12.Read Turingís original paper on AI (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several
objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry
weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments
since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer
will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator.
What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years--(2) REM

UNIT 3

15. Show that the 8-puzzle states are divided into two disjoint sets, such that any state is reachable from any other state in the same set, while no state is reachable from any state in the other set. (Hint: See Berlekamp et al. (1982).) Devise a procedure to decide which set a given state is in, and explain why this is useful for generating random states. --(10) Evaluate

facing north. You can turn the robot to face north, east, south, or west. You can direct the robot to move forward a certain distance, although it will stop before hitting a wall. a. Formulate this problem. How large is the state space? b. In navigating a maze, the only place we need to turn is at the intersection of two or more corridors. Reformulate this problem using this observation. How large is the state space now? c. Fromeach point in the maze, we can move in any of the four directions until we reach a turning point, and this is the only action we need to do. Reformulate the problem using these actions. Do we need to keep track of the robotís orientation now? d. In our initial description of the problem we already abstracted from the real world, restricting actions and removing details. List three such simpli?cations we made--(5) Apply
